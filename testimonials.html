		    Our introduction to Take Shape for Life has been truly outstanding! My wife Carol watched me lose 40 pounds in three months. She had also witnessed my significant change over the past year on maintaining a maintenance program with outstanding success. This success has provided increased energy, and what is more important, it has greatly reduced my medication intake. This is significant in that I was diagnosed with diabetes years back. Carol, seeing the tremendous success and ease decided to join the Take Shape for Life program and lost over 35 pounds with similar results. Both Carol and I are extremely thankful for Take Shape for Life, and especially having Kelly as our health coach for always keeping us on track!</p></td>

			  Lost 45 pounds<br />
			  <br />
		    After my twin boys were born, I had twenty five extra pounds of  weight to lose! I dieted for two years on more or less 1,800 calories a day,  and finally managed to lose the twenty pounds I&rsquo;d gained but I was hungry the  entire time! In the next ten years the     pounds slowly climbed back on while my special-needs  twins&rsquo; became my #1 priority. Eight years later, while at my doctors office  being treated for Fibromayalgia I realized I was the highest weight I had ever been! I am 5&rsquo; 4&rdquo; tall and I had hit 162 lbs. I was frustrated, I had been  putting my kids first, but not thinking about my own wellbeing. I also realized  that if I was unhealthy, both in body and in mind &ndash; I was not being the best  possible parent I could be and wanted to achieve health for life and pass on a legacy of good health and habits for my children to follow.</p>
		    <p>If &nbsp;you &nbsp;have tried to lose   weight and failed because  it was too hard   to navigate the change,   believe me, you are not alone! This  time I   believe you will succeed.</p></td>

			<strong>Best part is my new nick-name: &ldquo;Dr.          Skinny P.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br />
			It&rsquo;s just this simple: I had to bring sexy back!&nbsp; I was          disappointed in myself to be up to a size 40 waist (I wore 34&rsquo;s          back&nbsp;in grad school 20 years ago), and felt completely miserable          when I actually had to purchase 42s.&nbsp; I tried to convince myself          if was okay to be fat by buying some very nice (designer)          clothes.&nbsp; I thought &ldquo;well, I may be fat, but at least I am well          dressed!&rdquo;&nbsp; The good feeling was only temporary.&nbsp; I noticed just          how fit people in the metro DC area are.&nbsp; Health clubs abound,          as well as several commercial &ldquo;medical weight loss centers.&rdquo; I          tried one a few years ago which involved drugs. I did lose          weight, but gained it back soon after getting off the program.&nbsp;          Before starting with Washington Nutrition Group, I checked out two different          weight loss programs you hear advertised a lot. Both were VERY          expensive, and as much as I wanted to lose weight, I could not          justify the cost.</td>

		  <td colspan="3"><p>An out-of-state friend (who had an incredible weight loss)          suggested I look in my medical insurance provider directory for          a qualified nutritionist.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how I found Kelly, who is a          great coach.&nbsp; The MediFast program through Washington Nutrition Group is not only          affordable, but it works!&nbsp; The food tastes great too, such as          the Spiced Pancakes, the bars and especially the soups (Maryland          Crab is my favorite). With Kelly&rsquo;s help, the program has been          very easy to follow and stick with.&nbsp; My fat just melted away.&nbsp;          The first month I was losing about 3/4 pounds a day!&nbsp; In a          matter of weeks I was tossing out the size 42 pants.&nbsp; In just a          few more weeks, I was tossing out the size 40 pants and XXL          shirts.&nbsp; I retrieved my size 38 pants and XL shirts out of          storage (yep, I kept them) and felt like I had a whole new          wardrobe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before long, the 38 pants were falling off of me!&nbsp; I          am now in size 36 pants and size L shirt, and a few of them feel          a little loose.&nbsp; In addition my neck size went from an 18 inch          to a 16 inch.&nbsp; I no longer feel miserable clothes shopping!</p>
		    <p>		      All my friends and co-workers cannot believe how &ldquo;skinny&rdquo; I am          now, and in such a short period of time.&nbsp; And I feel great!&nbsp;          Everybody is asking me how I did it.&nbsp; I have learned that our          bodies simply do not require all the food we tend to put in it.&nbsp;          Many Americans simply overeat&hellip;the &ldquo;biggy&rdquo; phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve          also learned that lean meats, fresh vegetables and salads can be          filling, and actually taste good when not drowning in          artery-clogging ranch dressing or butter!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve learned to drink          plenty of water, and little tricks like taking a short walk or          chewing gum to ward off cravings.<br>
		      <br>
	        In summary, the MediFast program through Washington Nutrition Group works.&nbsp; No          simpler way to say it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lost almost&nbsp;75 pounds in just&nbsp;six          months, down from 265.&nbsp; Best part is my new nick-name: &ldquo;Dr.          Skinny P.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am serious!&nbsp; Lol!</p></td></tr>

  <p>In July 2013, I made the decision that I wanted to compete in the Miss Virginia USA pageant but I knew I didn't have the body for it.  But I didn't want that to be the reason I didn't compete, so I decided to make a change.  I needed to lose weight and I needed to lose it fast.  My desire to lose weight became a commitment to lose weight. </p>
  <p>I signed up for bootcamp and started seeing a nutritionist at Washington Nutrition Group Nutrition and Personal Training.  I was skeptical about what a nutritionist could do for me, but I quickly learned that EATING MATTERS more than you think.  I learned that losing weight cannot be achieved with exercise alone.  I followed a strict meal plan which meant cutting out pasta, bread, cheese, fried foods, and all the other unhealthhy foods that I once craved.  Losing weight meant sacrificing my favorite foods and I didn't think I could do it.  But I knew I had to let those foods go if I wanted to see the weight come off.</p></td>

Along with the weight loss came other unexpected benefits.  I find myself energized, happier, immune to stress/illness, and needing less sleep. <br>

I look you guys up, and you were covered by my insurance, which was great news. At the same time I started working towards my weight loss goals, so I thought maybe if they are helping with my colesterol at the same time I can get some assistant with loosing a couple of pounds.</p>
  <p>Now, I can fit in my old close again, which was a really big deal. In fact, I can't believe how loose my clothe fit. But all and all, the weight loss has really help my confidence. I feel more comfortable in my own skin. It just feels great.</p></td>
